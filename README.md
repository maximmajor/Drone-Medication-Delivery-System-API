# Drone-Medication-Delivery-System-API-Implementation
In this task, we have a fleet of 10 drones that are capable of carrying devices and delivering small loads, specifically medications. Each drone has unique attributes such as a serial number, model, weight limit, battery capacity, and state. Medications are characterized by their name, weight, code, and an image.


# Brief Summary of this Task
Drones:
Introduction:
Drones are an innovative and disruptive technology in the transportation field. Similar to how mobile phones revolutionized communication, drones have the potential to transform traditional transportation infrastructure. They are especially valuable for delivering small items to locations with difficult access.

Task Description:
In this task, we have a fleet of 10 drones that are capable of carrying devices and delivering small loads, specifically medications. Each drone has unique attributes such as a serial number, model, weight limit, battery capacity, and state. Medications are characterized by their name, weight, code, and image.

The goal is to develop a REST API service, known as the dispatch controller, that enables clients to interact with the drones. The API should provide the functionality to register a drone, load medication items onto a drone, check the loaded medication items for a specific drone, view available drones for loading, and check the battery level of a given drone. Design assumptions are allowed.



# To run and start the server, follow these steps:
```
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   git clone git@github.com:maximmajor/Drone-Medication-Delivery-System-API.git

3. run yarn (to Install dependencies)

4. Set environment variables:
   Create a .env file at the root of the project directory and add the following environment variables:
   for postgres
   DB_NAME=your-database
   DB_USERNAME=your-username
   DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   

5. run yarn tsc
   (This compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript code. and create a dist folder where it is stored.)

6. run yarn start
   (This will start the server and listen for incoming requests.)

   FOR DEVELOPEMENT ENVIRONMENT
7. run yarn watch
   (This will start the server and listen for incoming requests.)
```


# TO INTERACT WITH THE SERVER:
Once the server is running, you can interact with it using a tool like Postman 
or a browser extension. Here are some of the requests:

# Drone Service
```
1. Register Drone:
   POST localhost:3000/drone/
   Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "serialNumber": "SD25Y3",
    "model": "Lightweight",
    "weightLimit": 500,
    "batteryCapacity": 100,
    "state": "IDLE"
}

2. Get All Drones:
   GET localhost:3000/drone/
 

4. Get Drone By ID:
   GET localhost:3000/drone/:droneId

3. Update Drone:
   PUT localhost:3000/drone/:droneId
   Content-Type: application/json
 {  
    "state": "LOADING",
    "batteryCapacity": 500
}
 you can update either the state, battery capacity etc

4. Get Drone by the State
   GET localhost:3000/drone/by/state?name=DELIVERED
   The query should be any of these 'LOADED', 'DELIVERING', 'DELIVERED', 'RETURNING'

5. Get Drone by Battery Level
   GET localhost:3000/drone/by/level?word=above
   The query should be any of these "above" to get all drones with batteries above 25% and "below"  to get all the Drones with batteries levels below 25%
```
